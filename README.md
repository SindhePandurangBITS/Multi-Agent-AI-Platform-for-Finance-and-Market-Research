## üéØ Business Challenge

My goal in this project is to accelerate and enrich financial/market research, analysis by orchestrating specialized AI agents, RAG, LLMs to streamline research, document retrieval, stock analysis, market analysis and expert review. So that high-quality investment reports can be produced faster, with deeper insights and reliable sourcing.

## üß† Why AI Agents for Financial/Market Research?

* **Faster, Deeper Analysis**: Instantly synthesize data and news far beyond manual tools.
* **Collaborative Expertise**: Specialized agents cover research, retrieval, analysis, and review in one workflow.
* **Up-to-Date & Cited**: Agents pull the latest info and transparently cite sources‚Äîno more stale data.

## ü§ñ AI Agent Roles and Capabilities Overview :

| **Agent** | **Role / Specialty**               | **Main Parameters / Components**                                                             | **Special Functions / Tools**                                             |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent 1   | Financial/Market Research & Web Search    | - GoogleSearchAPIWrapper<br>- ChatOpenAI (gpt-4.1)<br>- Article extraction with requests\_html | Fetches news, scrapes articles, sources market insights                   |
| Agent 2   | RAG Document Retrieval & QA        | - HuggingFaceEmbeddings<br>- Chroma vector DB<br>- PyPDFLoader<br>- OpenAI (gpt-3.5-turbo)   | Loads/splits PDFs, builds vector store, answers with retrieval QA         |
| Agent 3   | Stock Data & Financial/Market Analysis    | - yfinance<br>- ChatOpenAI (ggpt-4o)<br>- ReAct agent with custom prompt               | Live stock info (price, ratios), structured multi-ticker comparison       |
| Agent 4   | Review & Synthesis (RAG Evaluator) | - Custom RAGReview class<br>- ChatOpenAI (gpt-o4-mini-high)<br>- PromptTemplate scoring rubric  | Scores output (accuracy, relevance, citations), synthesizes and critiques |


**Evaluation criteria with metrics:**

* **Accuracy & Relevance**: Are insights factually correct and directly answer the query? *(Measured by correctness and relevance scores)*
* **Response Latency (LangChain Metric):** How quickly each agent returns an answer, measured in seconds‚Äîcritical for time-sensitive financial analysis.
* **Contextual Relevance & Factuality (Model Metrics):** Are answers accurate and grounded in retrieved documents or live data? Evaluated by fact-checking rate and retrieval overlap.
* **Citation Quality & Traceability (Custom/Chain Metric):** Do responses provide clear, verifiable source links or references? Scored by presence and completeness of citations.

## üèÜ Project Goals

1. **Multi-Source Data Acquisition**
   * Real-time news search, PDF document retrieval, and live financial data extraction.
2. **Automated Knowledge Extraction**
   * LLM-driven summarization, RAG-based context retrieval, and structured stock metric parsing.
3. **Agent Orchestration**
   * Workflow routing: query ‚Üí research agent ‚Üí RAG agent ‚Üí analysis agent ‚Üí review agent.
4. **Synthesis & Structured Reporting**
   * Section-wise assembly: executive summary, financials, risk, peer analysis, citations.
5. **Evaluation & Validation**
   * Metrics: response latency, factual accuracy, citation completeness, relevance scoring.
6. **Result Delivery & Transparency**
   * Export as markdown/PDF, all findings traceable to cited, time-stamped sources.
